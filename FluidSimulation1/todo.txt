now every particle always checks collision with everything that exists:

improve this by dividing the screen into small square the size of the particle interaction radius

and a particle only checks for interactions in the squares that surround the square that contains its center (6 squares in total)

downside would be that you need to always update the inside of all the squares so memory shoould increase but i think that it is worth
